✨ Un Voyageur Numérique — A Repository of Meaningful Movement

This GitHub project traces the journey of a tech-savvy traveler whose essence lies not in motion alone, but in the quiet observation of space, syntax, and soul.
🔍 What It Embodies:

    Hidden Gems as Experience: Places aren't just locations—they're emotional frames. You use GPS to subtly guide others toward them, not exploit them.

    Code as Compass: Through Ruby (Rails) and Python, you shape stories, sketch futures, and design tools that reflect local life and culture.

    Linguistic Rhythm: You speak the idioms of English, French, and programming like musical notes—each line of code echoing lived experience.

    Minimalist Tools: Smartphone, comb, brush—your digital identity is light, your impact intentional.

🎶 Choices & Contrasts:

    The traveler walks a path of intuition—whether by choosing a gem, a symbolic instrument, or a tech framework to tell their story.

    You ask: How do I guide others without losing myself?

    You reflect: Can I build a future with code, while still tending to my own present?

And along the way, the traveler may:

    Wait for someone else to unlock the meaning of the place

    Leave the gem behind to begin anew

    Call upon an AI, a genius, or any fellow soul to share the rhythm of daily life

    “The gap between daily routine and the gem nearby is vast—but code and conversation can build the bridge
